/* Challenge Mentors

Write all your code at the end of the file

1. Loop through the array, and for each object, `console.log()` out the sentence only for
mentors that are in Barcelona and one of the skills is React
"Hi, my name is {firstName} {lastName}. I work in Barcelona and i know React."

2. To those that work in Barcelona, set "Jun1" in the class attribute, 
and add a new skill to the list "SQL".
To add elements in an array you can use .push()
var animals = ["dog","cat"];
animals.push("horse"); //["dog","cat","horse"]

let sequence = [1, 2, 3];
sequence.push(4);
sequence.push(5);
console.log(sequence);
// â†’ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

3. Create an object method with the name .addSkill() to be able to add skills from it

4. Create a function to add a skill to all members in a list of mentors

function addSkill(mentors,newSkill){
  //your code here
}

5. Create a function to remove a skill to all members in a list of mentors

function removeSkill(mentors,newSkill){
  //your code here
}

6. Create a function mentorWithMoreSkills() that returns the name of the mentor with more number of skills

7. Create an object method .addStudentLikes() that increments by one the attribute studentLikes

8. Create a function that adds a student like to all mentors in the array

function addStudentLikes(mentors){
  //your code here
}
